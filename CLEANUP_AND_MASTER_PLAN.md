# HCM VARIANT RESEARCH: CLEANUP & MASTER PLAN

## 🧹 DIRECTORY CLEANUP PLAN

### ✅ KEEP (Essential Research Assets)
```
📊 CORE DATA:
- MYH7_variants_final_annotated.csv (5,890 variants - our gold mine)
- MYH7_native.pdb (reference structure)
- variant_*.yaml files (4 high-priority test cases)
- create_variants.py (variant generation pipeline)

🧬 SOURCE CODE:
- src/variant_analysis.py (22KB - core analysis code)
- src/demo_analysis.py (4KB - demo code)
- data/ directory (molecules & variants)

📝 DOCUMENTATION:
- publication_strategy.md (our publication roadmap)
- README.md (project overview)

🔧 PRODUCTION TOOLS:
- ssl_fix_boltz.sh (working SSL solution)
- .git/ (version control)
```

### 📦 ARCHIVE (Move to archive/)
```
- SLURM_GUIDE.md → archive/docs/
- boltz2_status.txt → archive/docs/
- next_steps_boltz2.txt → archive/docs/
- All experimental Slurm scripts → archive/cluster_scripts/
- setup_slurm_environment.sh → archive/
- environment*.yml → archive/
```

### 🗑️ DELETE (Redundant/Empty)
```
- Multiple submission scripts (keep 1 final version)
- Empty result directories (no actual structures)
- Duplicate Slurm job files
- Old log files
```
