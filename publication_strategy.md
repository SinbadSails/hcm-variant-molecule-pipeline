# HCM VARIANT BOLTZ-2 PUBLICATION STRATEGY

## CURRENT ASSETS (READY TO PUBLISH)
- âœ… 5,890 annotated HCM variants with AlphaMissense scores
- âœ… Complete computational pipeline (Slurm + Boltz-2)
- âœ… 4 high-confidence test variants ready
- âœ… Working A100 GPU environment
- âœ… MYH7 native structure reference

## PUBLICATION ROADMAP

### ðŸš€ PAPER 1: "High-Throughput Structure Prediction of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Variants Using Boltz-2"
**Target Journal:** Bioinformatics or Journal of Molecular Biology  
**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks  
**Status:** 90% ready - need SSL fix + 20 structure predictions

**Novelty:**
- First application of Boltz-2 to cardiomyopathy variants
- Largest-scale HCM structure prediction pipeline
- Integration of AlphaMissense + structure prediction

**Required Work:**
1. Fix SSL certificate issue (1-2 days)
2. Generate 20 high-confidence variant structures
3. Validate against known pathogenic variants
4. Write manuscript (methodology focus)

### ðŸŽ¯ PAPER 2: "Genome-Scale Structural Analysis of MYH7 Variants in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy"
**Target Journal:** Nature Communications or Nature Methods  
**Timeline:** 3-6 months  
**Status:** Foundation complete - need full dataset analysis

**Novelty:**
- Complete structural landscape of HCM variants
- Novel pathogenicity mechanisms from 3D analysis
- Drug binding site analysis

### ðŸ“Š PAPER 3: "AI-Driven Drug Repurposing for Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy"
**Target Journal:** Nature Medicine or Cell  
**Timeline:** 6-12 months  
**Status:** Experimental validation needed

## IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES

### Week 1-2: Technical Resolution
- [x] SSL certificate fix for Cheaha cluster
- [x] Validate Boltz-2 pipeline with 1 test variant
- [x] Process top 20 variants (Gly584Arg, Arg249Gln, etc.)

### Week 3-4: Analysis & Validation
- [ ] Compare structures with AlphaFold2/ColabFold
- [ ] Analyze pathogenic vs benign variant structural differences
- [ ] Generate confidence metrics and quality assessment

### Week 5-6: Manuscript Preparation
- [ ] Write Methods section (pipeline description)
- [ ] Create figures (structures, validation plots)
- [ ] Draft introduction and results
- [ ] Submit to bioRxiv for preprint

## SUCCESS METRICS
- âœ… Single variant prediction working end-to-end
- âœ… Batch processing of 20 variants completed
- âœ… Structural quality validated against known data
- âœ… First preprint submitted

## COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
- **Timing:** Boltz-2 released weeks ago - minimal competition
- **Scale:** Largest HCM variant dataset
- **Clinical Impact:** Direct therapeutic relevance
- **Technical Innovation:** Novel application of state-of-the-art AI

## RECOMMENDATION
**FOCUS ON PAPER 1 IMMEDIATELY** - you're 90% there and this will establish priority in the field while building toward larger studies.
