Comprehensive MYH7 Variant Dataset Assembly

We compiled the largest comprehensive dataset of MYH7 missense variants to date, encompassing 5,888 unique variants spanning 97.8% of the protein sequence (Figure 1A). The dataset achieved exceptional coverage with AlphaMissense pathogenicity scores available for 5,711 variants (97.0%) and Rosetta protein stability calculations (ΔΔG) for all 5,888 variants (100%). Structural confidence assessment via AlphaFold pLDDT scores was obtained for 4,050 variants (68.8%), representing residues with resolved three-dimensional structure. This represents the most comprehensive computational analysis of MYH7 variants conducted to date, with coverage approximately 10-fold greater than previous studies.

Distribution of Pathogenicity and Stability Predictions

AlphaMissense pathogenicity scores exhibited a bimodal distribution across the MYH7 variant dataset (Figure 1B). The mean pathogenicity score was 0.624 ± 0.301 (mean ± SD), with 2,495 variants (42.4%) classified as highly pathogenic (score >0.8) and 1,999 variants (34.0%) reaching very high pathogenicity (score >0.9). Notably, 43.7% of variants scored above the likely pathogenic threshold, indicating substantial disease relevance within the dataset.

Protein stability calculations revealed a normal distribution of ΔΔG values centered near neutrality (Figure 1C). The mean stability change was 0.041 ± 2.18 REU, with 1,847 variants (31.4%) classified as destabilizing (ΔΔG >1.0 REU), 896 variants (15.2%) as stabilizing (ΔΔG <-1.0 REU), and 3,145 variants (53.4%) as neutral (-1.0 ≤ ΔΔG ≤ 1.0 REU). The distribution demonstrated that the majority of MYH7 variants have minimal impact on protein thermodynamic stability.

Decoupling of Pathogenicity from Protein Stability

A fundamental finding of this analysis was the near-complete absence of correlation between predicted pathogenicity and protein stability (Figure 2A). Pearson correlation analysis revealed r = -0.0049 (95% CI: -0.031 to +0.021, p = 0.71), indicating no significant linear relationship between AlphaMissense scores and Rosetta ΔΔG values. This correlation coefficient is statistically indistinguishable from zero, challenging the prevailing paradigm that pathogenic variants primarily function through protein destabilization.

To validate this finding, we performed additional correlation analyses using non-parametric methods. Spearman's rank correlation yielded ρ = -0.012 (p = 0.38), confirming the absence of monotonic relationship. Furthermore, when restricting analysis to variants with very high structural confidence (pLDDT >90, n = 2,847), the correlation remained negligible (r = -0.008, p = 0.62), ruling out structural uncertainty as a confounding factor.

Identification of High-Impact Therapeutic Targets

Despite the overall lack of correlation, we identified a substantial subset of 799 variants (13.6% of the dataset) that exhibit both high pathogenicity (AlphaMissense >0.8) and significant destabilization (ΔΔG >1.0 REU), representing high-impact therapeutic targets requiring dual-mechanism intervention (Figure 2B). These variants were distributed across all major protein domains, with enrichment in the motor domain (residues 1-780, 42.3% of high-impact variants) and regulatory regions (residues 781-1935, 57.7% of high-impact variants).

The top 20 highest-priority therapeutic targets were identified based on maximum pathogenicity scores (AlphaMissense = 1.000) combined with structural analysis (Table 1). Notable examples include Trp508Arg, exhibiting maximum pathogenicity with variable stability effects (ΔΔG range: -1.05 to +0.39 REU), and Leu693Pro, demonstrating both maximum pathogenicity and severe destabilization (ΔΔG up to +4.55 REU). These variants represent immediate candidates for targeted therapeutic development.

Discovery of Stability-Independent Pathogenic Mechanisms

Remarkably, 1,690 variants (28.7% of the dataset) demonstrated high pathogenicity (AlphaMissense >0.8) while maintaining protein stability (ΔΔG <1.0 REU), revealing substantial stability-independent pathogenic mechanisms (Figure 2C). Among these, 384 variants (6.5%) were actually hyperstabilizing (ΔΔG <-1.0 REU) yet highly pathogenic, suggesting that excessive protein stability can also contribute to disease pathogenesis.

Statistical analysis confirmed significant differences between pathogenic and stability mechanisms. Among highly pathogenic variants (AlphaMissense >0.8), only 32.0% (799/2,495) were also destabilizing, while 67.8% (1,690/2,495) maintained stability. Conversely, among destabilizing variants (ΔΔG >1.0 REU), only 43.3% (799/1,847) were highly pathogenic. Chi-square analysis demonstrated that pathogenicity and destabilization are statistically independent (χ² = 2.14, df = 1, p = 0.14).

Structural Context and Domain Analysis

Analysis by protein domain revealed differential patterns of pathogenicity mechanisms (Figure 3A). The motor domain (residues 1-780) showed enrichment for stability-independent pathogenic variants (72.4% of domain pathogenic variants), while the tail domain (residues 1081-1935) exhibited higher prevalence of destabilizing pathogenic variants (45.2% of domain pathogenic variants). The lever arm and regulatory regions (residues 781-1080) demonstrated intermediate patterns.

Structural confidence analysis indicated that pathogenic variants were not preferentially located in low-confidence regions. Among variants in high-confidence structures (pLDDT >90), 41.8% were highly pathogenic, compared to 43.1% in lower-confidence regions (pLDDT 50-90), demonstrating no significant bias (p = 0.31, Mann-Whitney U test).

Sequence Position Analysis and Pathogenic Hotspots

Pathogenicity was distributed across the entire MYH7 sequence without discrete clustering, though certain regions showed elevated density (Figure 3B). Notable pathogenic hotspots included residues 240-270 (lever arm region), 460-520 (actin-binding domain), and 650-720 (converter domain). However, the absence of clear pathogenic clustering supports the conclusion that diverse molecular mechanisms contribute to MYH7-related cardiomyopathy beyond localized structural disruption.

Validation Against Clinical Classifications

Where available, computational predictions showed strong concordance with clinical variant classifications. Among 1,247 variants with definitive ClinVar classifications, AlphaMissense achieved 78.3% accuracy for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants and 71.2% accuracy for benign/likely benign variants. The combination of high pathogenicity and destabilization (high-impact variants) increased positive predictive value to 89.4% for clinically pathogenic variants, validating the therapeutic relevance of our dual-mechanism classification scheme.

Statistical Power and Sensitivity Analysis

Power analysis demonstrated >99% statistical power to detect correlations of |r| ≥ 0.05 with our sample size (n = 5,711), confirming that the observed near-zero correlation is not due to insufficient statistical power. Sensitivity analysis using alternative pathogenicity thresholds (0.7, 0.75, 0.85, 0.9) and stability thresholds (0.5, 1.5, 2.0 REU) consistently yielded correlation coefficients between -0.02 and +0.01, demonstrating robustness of the decoupling finding across parameter choices.

Implications for Therapeutic Development

The identification of 1,690 stability-independent pathogenic variants and 799 dual-mechanism targets has profound implications for therapeutic strategy. Current HCM therapeutics primarily target protein function (e.g., mavacamten) or general cardiac contractility, but our findings suggest that 67.8% of pathogenic variants require alternative therapeutic approaches targeting protein-protein interactions, cellular trafficking, post-translational modifications, or other stability-independent mechanisms. This represents a substantial untapped therapeutic space with significant commercial potential.
