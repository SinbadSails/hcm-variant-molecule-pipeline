Figure 1. Comprehensive Analysis of MYH7 Variant Dataset
A) Overview of variant distribution across the MYH7 protein sequence (1,935 amino acids). Heat map showing variant density by position, with protein domains annotated (motor domain: residues 1-780; lever arm: 781-850; regulatory region: 851-1080; tail domain: 1081-1935). Total of 5,888 unique missense variants analyzed.

B) Distribution of AlphaMissense pathogenicity scores across all variants. Histogram showing bimodal distribution with peak at low pathogenicity (0.1-0.3) and secondary peak at high pathogenicity (0.8-1.0). Dashed lines indicate classification thresholds: likely pathogenic (0.8) and very high pathogenicity (0.9). Mean = 0.624 ± 0.301, n = 5,711.

C) Distribution of Rosetta protein stability changes (ΔΔG) for all variants. Normal distribution centered near neutrality, with positive values indicating destabilization and negative values indicating stabilization. Dashed lines indicate significance thresholds at ±1.0 REU. Mean = 0.041 ± 2.18 REU, n = 5,888.

Figure 2. Decoupling of Pathogenicity from Protein Stability
A) Scatter plot of AlphaMissense pathogenicity scores vs. Rosetta ΔΔG values for all 5,711 variants with both measurements. Each point represents one variant, with color density indicating overlapping variants. Linear regression line shown with 95% confidence interval (gray shading). Pearson correlation: r = -0.0049, p = 0.71.

B) Identification of high-impact therapeutic targets. Four-quadrant plot categorizing variants by pathogenicity (AlphaMissense >0.8) and destabilization (ΔΔG >1.0 REU). Top-right quadrant (red) shows 799 high-impact variants requiring dual-mechanism intervention. Notable variants labeled with clinical significance.

C) Discovery of stability-independent pathogenic variants. Distribution of ΔΔG values for highly pathogenic variants (AlphaMissense >0.8, n = 2,495). Histogram showing that 67.8% of pathogenic variants maintain protein stability (ΔΔG <1.0 REU), including 384 variants that are hyperstabilizing (ΔΔG <-1.0 REU).

Figure 3. Structural and Domain Analysis
A) Pathogenicity mechanisms by protein domain. Stacked bar chart showing the proportion of pathogenic variants that are destabilizing vs. stability-independent for each major protein domain (motor, lever arm, regulatory, tail). Motor domain shows 72.4% stability-independent pathogenic variants.

B) Structural confidence analysis. Violin plots comparing pathogenicity distributions for variants in high-confidence (pLDDT >90) vs. lower-confidence (pLDDT 50-90) structural regions. No significant difference observed (p = 0.31, Mann-Whitney U test), ruling out structural uncertainty as confounding factor.

C) Sequence position analysis of pathogenic hotspots. Linear plot of pathogenicity density along the MYH7 sequence, with notable peaks at residues 240-270 (lever arm), 460-520 (actin-binding), and 650-720 (converter domain). Absence of discrete clustering supports diverse pathogenic mechanisms.
