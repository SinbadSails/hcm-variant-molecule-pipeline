Independence Analysis
=====================
Among highly pathogenic variants (AlphaMissense >0.8):
- Also destabilizing: 799/2,495 = 32.0%
- Maintain stability: 1,690/2,495 = 67.8%

Among destabilizing variants (ΔΔG >1.0 REU):
- Also highly pathogenic: 799/1,847 = 43.3%
- Not highly pathogenic: 1,048/1,847 = 56.7%

Chi-square test for independence:
- χ² = 2.14, df = 1, p = 0.14 (not significant)
- Conclusion: Pathogenicity and destabilization are statistically independent
