## ⏳ IMMEDIATE BLOCKERS

### 🔑 **GPU Access** (Critical)
- ❌ Need `amperemedmaxgputres` QoS for A100 GPUs
- ❌ Current QoS: `normal` (insufficient for GPU partitions)
- 🎯 **Action**: Email Cheaha support TODAY

### 📧 **Support Request Template**
```
To: support@cheaha.rc.uab.edu
Subject: GPU QoS Access Request - HCM Research
